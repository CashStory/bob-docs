# Benefits
As the pace of legacy migration quickens, CASHSTORY offers a modern web solution for the financial desktop and a bridge to get there. By leveraging new technologies and open source code, stakeholders take control of the development and desktop experience without compromising the stability of a unified system.

Developers are empowered to build modern web apps that can run with native experience, yet be deployed and updated from the cloud
Info-sec teams and desktop administrators get a sandboxed target for apps where they can control all critical aspects of security
End users get the apps they need on their desktops now, with the app experience and productivity they enjoy on their mobile devices. With CASHSTORY, everyone benefits

## Users Experience
### Finance professionals
In the financial industry, desktop optimization is vital for end users. Without a dependable user interface that permits apps to work together, end users lose valuable time on repetitive, manual tasks. CASHSTORY breaks away from the confines of the common native app interface to enable seamless workflow management for end users.

With CASHSTORY, end users can

- Effortlessly engage with all apps in one unified workspace
- Create a unique desktop environment by organizing windows with snap & dock and tabbing
- Automate repetitive tasks with the Data Hub

### IT professionals & developpers
Developer Experience
Up to 50% of development time and testing is spent on cross-browser compatibility. Up to 70% of production problems are related to browser issues. Questions of cost and time can stifle innovation. CASHSTORY eradicates these issues by leveraging new Fintech innovation and capabilities without siloing developers to specific platforms.

With CASHSTORY, developers can:

- Leverage FDC3, an open source standard that enables interoperability across the financial desktop
- Eliminate long development schedules by enabling true iterative development
- Create multiple apps with one engine that works seamlessly on all platforms - Windows, Mac, Linux - to drastically reduce cost for new functionality and make improvements, revisions, and innovations more dynamic
- Integrate legacy apps into an updated, conscious workflow. CASHSTORY tools work hand-in-hand with every other application, whether it’s brand-new software or critical legacy tech
- Share data organically. Fields populate in real time across multiple apps. Research, analytics, price feeds, chat, order books and more create a landscape of interwoven cross-functionality that enables you to spend more time executing and less time doing digital chores manually

### Security

With CASHSTORY, apps are secure by default. Apps are completely partitioned from the native OS – and each other – with sandboxing. Preventing vulnerabilities that can compromise the end user’s desktop and eliminating the need for never-ending security reviews that draw out deployment timelines.

Conventional wisdom has it that slow change equals security. But Google alone delivers major new versions of Chromium every 6 weeks and additional security fixes in between. CASHSTORY’s engineering team does the hard work of keeping up with Google, making it easy for you to instantly push security fixes and to ensure backward compatibility of your apps.

### Deployment
CASHSTORY eliminates deployment issues that are common in native desktop development. Long deployment schedules affect not only the developer, but the end user as well.

With CASHSTORY, developers can:

- Eliminate long deployment schedules thanks to technology that allows immediate updates and remote debugging
- Seamlessly deploy to thousands of desktops at once
- Deploy anywhere, at anytime and choose when to update, even on a customer’s desktop

There are also plenty of ways to deploy. Whether it’s a single app or an entire enterprise of apps that need to be deployed, CASHSTORY has a solution.

### Group Policy
Manually setting desktop policy and monitoring security desktop-by-desktop is not only a headache, but a potential security threat. CASHSTORY tackles this issue by offering a wholesale solution for desktop administrative tasks.

With CASHSTORY, IT administrators can
- Restrict and whitelist native apps with CASHSTORY APIs
- Control which domains an CASHSTORY application can target for resource assets
- Manage an app’s ability to programmatically read the system clipboard or launch an external process
- Desktop admins can manage all of these settings through the Desktop Owner Settings file, making it as easy as possible to keep end user desktops secure.


# Open Source 
CASHSTORY was created from the input of many people and is currently being used by several of the world’s leading industries, buy-side firms, and trading platforms. It only made sense to continue that collaboration effort by offering all of our source code as open source.

Open-sourcing enables others to help set the standard for interoperability of business or tech applications and enhance the core OS. 

Customers also have assurance and control over their applications as they use CASHSTORY for deployment. The foundation of CASHSTORY OS is built on the Nebular open source project. We actively contribute to this project to support the core security and performance needs of enterprise-grade applications.
