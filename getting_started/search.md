To open the search bar in your workspace you can click the search icon in the left corner of the header or you can use the shortcut key **ctrl+f**. 

## How to use

Once the search bar is open you can search the box name you are looking for by typing it in the input. You can also use the vocal search (microphone icon), and allow access to your microphone in your browser. If the box is found you will automatically be redirected on it.

If you search for a box but you have not exactly the complete or right name it will still redirect you to the box which match the most.

If nothing matches your search the search bar will suggest a box name to you according to what you tried to search. This suggestion will appear with the question "Did you mean?" above the input. 

If you want to use the vocal search you need to click on the microphone icon and allow the browser to access your microphone (if it is not already done). Then it will record what you say and automatically write it in the searchbar.
