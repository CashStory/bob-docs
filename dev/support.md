# Support and debugging

Cashstory provides application providers with the tools needed to support their applications and customers. These features range from the Chromium DevTools to API calls for collecting raw data about a user’s machine.

## Debugging your app

We provide you with the Chrome DevTools for easy and efficient debugging. This is the way to debug your Cashstory app:

- Launch Chrome browser
- Enter the app URL

With this setting, you will be able to right-click on your app and select “Inspect Element” to open developer tools.

## Memory profiling
Through DevTools, Chromium offers a comprehensive set of tools to profile your application. This tutorial <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/heap-profiling" target="_blank">tutorial</a> is a good resource for application developers.

## APIs
Cashstory offers several API calls that can be used directly by application providers for their support needs. 

Cashstory recommends logging information on a regular basis from the client back to your server/db, as well as active metric gathering when an error or other issue occurs in your application.
