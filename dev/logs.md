# Log management
## Overview
In Cashstory events done by the user like login are send to the logs. Application logging allows applications to have their own, separate logs that can be retrieved for later use by the App Provider. Anything logged by the app will go to a separate folder and file in the Cashstory database.

Logs are in json format : 
```json
 {
    "creatorId": "5da886a8918b2b1ffscchh4",
    "action": "login",
    "prevData": {},
    "newData": {},
    "context": {},
    "collectionName": "auth"
  }
```
